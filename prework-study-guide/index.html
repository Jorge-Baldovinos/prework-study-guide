        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML plays an important role in the functionality and accessability of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata, contained within the head element, offers vital information towards the proper performance of the website as well as its accessability and search engine optimization</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a programming language that defines how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS determines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>The three approaches to styling a webpage using CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Internal CSS contain rules that only apply to that webpage.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is embeddewd within the head elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS uses a linked file to apply all the CSS rules to the webpage.</li>
          <li>External CSS is the prefered styling method as keeping the CSS rules in a separate file makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A CSS Rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector assigns the rules to an element and the declaration block contains the property and value assigned.</li>
